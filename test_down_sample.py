# # Quick start guide
# This notebook serves as an example of how to train a simple model using pytorch and the ready-to-train AI4Arctic
# challenge dataset. Initially, a dictionary, 'train_options', is set up with relevant options for both the example
# U-Net Convolutional Neural Network model and the dataloader. Note that the weights of the U-Net will be initialised
# at random and therefore not deterministic - results will vary for every training run. Two lists (dataset.json and
# testset.json) include the names of the scenes relevant to training and testing, where the former can be altered
# if desired. Training data is loaded in parallel using the build-in torch Dataset and Dataloader classes, and
# works by randomly sampling a scene and performing a random crop to extract a patch. Each batch will then be compiled
# of X number of these patches with the patch size in the 'train_options'. An obstacle is different grid resolution
# sizes, which is overcome by upsampling low resolution variables, e.g. AMSR2, ERA5, to match the SAR pixels.
# A number of batches will be prepared in parallel and stored until use, depending on the number of workers (processes)
# spawned (this can be changed in 'num_workers' in 'train_options').
# The model is trained on a fixed number of steps according to the number of batches in an epoch,
# defined by the 'epoch_len' parameter, and will run for a total number of epochs depending on the 'epochs' parameter.
# After each epoch, the model is evaluated. In this example, a random number of scenes are sampled among the training
# scenes (and removed from the list of training scenes) to act as a validation set used for the evaluation.
# The model is evaluated with the metrics, and if the current validation attempt is superior to the previous,
# then the model parameters are stored in the 'best_model' file in the directory.
#
# The models are scored on the three sea ice parameters; Sea Ice Concentration (SIC), Stage of Development (SOD) and
# the Floe size (FLOE) with the $RÂ²$ metric for the SIC, and the weighted F1 metric for the SOD and FLOE. The 3 scores
# are combined into a single metric by taking the weighted average with SIC and SOD being weighted with 2 and the FLOE
# with 1.
#
# Finally, once you are ready to test your model on the test scenes (without reference data), the 'test_upload'
# notebook will produce model outputs with your model of choice and save the output as a netCDF file, which can be
# uploaded to the AI4EO.eu website. The model outputs will be evaluated and then you will receive a score.
#
# This quick start notebook is by no means necessary to utilize, and you are more than welcome to develop your own
# data pipeline. We do however require that the model output is stored in a netcdf file with xarray.dataarrays titled
# '{scene_name}_{chart}', i.e. 3 charts per scene / file (see how in 'test_upload'). In addition, you are more than
# welcome to create your own preprocessing scheme to prepare the raw AI4Arctic challenge dataset. However, we ask that
# the model output is in 80 m pixel spacing (original is 40 m), and that you follow the class numberings from the
# lookup tables in 'utils' - at least you will be evaluated in this way. Furthermore, we have included a function to
# convert the polygon_icechart to SIC, SOD and FLOE, you will have to incorporate it yourself.
#
# The first cell imports the necessary Python packages, initializes the 'train_options' dictionary
# the sample U-Net options, loads the dataset list and select validation scenes.
